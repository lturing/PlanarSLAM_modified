# PlanarSLAM
This repo proposes a RGB-D SLAM system specifically designed for structured environments and aimed at improved tracking and mapping accuracy by relying on geometric features that are extracted from the surrounding. More details can be found in our papers ([RGB-D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07997) and [Monocular](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01963)).  

**Authors:** Yanyan Li, Raza Yunus, Nikolas Brasch, Nassir Navab and Federico Tombari

### updated on 11.12.2021

We updated the planar meshing section by making use of a more efficient triangulation method, rather than the greedy algorithm from PCL. If the PCL window shows nothing, maybe you could click "R" after selecting the window. 

ps: the reconstruction method is still very naive, we will keep moving.

## 1. Prerequisites

We have tested the library in **ubuntu 16.04** and **ubuntu 18.04**, but it should be easy to compile on other platforms. A powerful computer (e.g. i7) will ensure real-time performance and provide more stable and accurate results.

### C++11 or C++0x Compiler
We use the new thread and chrono functionalities of C++11.

### Pangolin
We use [Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) for visualization and user interface. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.

### OpenCV and **OpenCV_Contrib**
We use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) and corresponding **OpenCV_Contrib** to manipulate images and features. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org. **Tested with OpenCV 3.4.1**

### Eigen3
Required by g2o (see below). Download and install instructions can be found at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. **Required at least 3.1.0**.

### DBoW2 and g2o (Included in Thirdparty folder)
We use modified versions of the [DBoW2](https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2) library to perform place recognition and [g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) library to perform non-linear optimizations. Both modified libraries (which are BSD) are included in the *Thirdparty* folder.

### PCL

We use [PCL](http://www.pointclouds.org/) to reconstruct and visualize mesh. Download and install instructions can be found at: https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl. **Tested with PCL 1.7.0 and 1.9.0**.

1. https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/releases

2. compile and install

   ```
   cd pcl 
   mkdir release 
   cd release
   
   cmake  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \ -DBUILD_GPU=ON -DBUILD_apps=ON -DBUILD_examples=ON \ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DPCL_DIR=/usr/local/share/pcl  .. 
   
   make -j12
   sudo make install
   ```



## 2. Test the system

### Structural Public Scenes

[ICL NUIM](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ahanda/VaFRIC/iclnuim.html), [Structural TUM RGB-D](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download), All types of Corridors

### Test the system locally

1. Download **'freiburg3_structure_texture_far'** and  associate RGB-D pairs based on [associate.py](http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/tools) provided by the dataset.

   ```
   python associate.py PATH_TO_SEQUENCE/rgb.txt PATH_TO_SEQUENCE/depth.txt > associations.txt
   ```

2. Compile the system

```
./build.sh
```

â€‹	3.  Run the system

```
./Examples/RGB-D/Planar_SLAM Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/RGB-D/TUM3.yaml PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER .PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER/ASSOCIATIONS_FILE
```

*similar command for testing ICL-NUIM sequences*

```
./Examples/RGB-D/Planar_SLAM Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/RGB-D/ICL.yaml PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER  PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER/ASSOCIATIONS_FILE

```
